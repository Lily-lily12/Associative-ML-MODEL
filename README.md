# Associative-ML-MODEL

There are two machine learning models that come under associative machine learning.These algorithm are used for discovering item sets (group of items) which occurs frequently in a transaction database.
The difference between the implementation of the Apriori and Eclat algorithms lies primarily in their approach to generating frequent itemsets and identifying association rules. While both algorithms aim to discover frequent itemsets, they have distinct strategies for achieving this goal. Here's a high-level overview of the differences in the code implementation:

The parameters in Apriori are support,confidence and life
The parameter in Eclat is support 
Apriori is a join-based algorithm, and ECLAT is a tree-based algorithm. Apriori work is in horizontal data format, and ECLAT work is in vertical data format.
In the project below, I am using Apriori Algorithm for market basket optimisation
